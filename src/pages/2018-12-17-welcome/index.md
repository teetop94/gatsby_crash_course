#### FULL-STACK DEVELOPMENT
Well, there are already a ton of answers, and all seem to have something of value in them. I'll see if I can add anything...

If we're talking about web application development, you could say:
Back-end languages: just about anything.
Front-end languages: just about anything.

We often think of back-end languages as code that's processed by something built in to the web server itself or a plugin to the server, but it's possible for a script written in one of those back-end languages to launch external processes (native applications) on the server, so really, you could use just  about anything as a back-end language, from compiled C/C++ to a bash shell script. (Whether it makes sense to do that is another thing.)

As for front-end languages, I think of a front end as anything that the user interacts with directly. That could be an app running in a web browser, a "thick client" desktop application, or a native application on a mobile device. So again, really, there's a huge array there.

If you want lists, for back-end languages (in order of my ability to recall):
* Java (and other JVM languages like Scala, Groovy, Clojure)
* PHP
* .NET (C#, VB)
* Ruby
* Python
* Perl
* Javascript  (Node JS)
* Actionscript (Flash Media Server)
* CoffeeScript
* C (CGI)


For browser-based front-end languages, you're somewhat limited in what the browser can support (excluding launching out-of-browser applications). We could talk about:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS
* Actionscript
* CoffeeScript (compiled to Javascript)
* XML-based languages (X3D, SMIL, SVG, DITA, some interpreted by the browser, others transformed using XSL)
* VBScript
* Silverlight
* Java (applets)

For native PC desktop front-ends, most popular front-end languages would probably be (I'm guessing, in no order): 
Visual Basic 6 (from my experience with big enterprises, I bet a lot of those are still out there, just like Windows Vista)
.NET
Java (Swing apps)

But just about every language that can create desktop apps also has some net code library that lets you write n-tiered applications (Kivy (Python), Tcl/Tk, ...).

For native mobile application front-ends, most popular would probably be: 
Objective C (for iOS apps)
Java (Android apps)

But if you just want most popular (browser-based) web application development stacks, that would probably some combination of the following:

Front-end: HTML / Javascript / CSS
Back-end: PHP / Java / Javascript / Ruby / .NET / Python

I'm not sure any of this information is actually helpful. I'm sure I haven't captured lots. You can always go to **PragProg (The Pragmatic Bookshelf)** to find out what the latest language of the week is :-)
