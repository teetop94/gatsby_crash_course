#### FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT
Hello everyone, we are going to be learning programming lanuages together especially Front-end Languages, some languages and markup languges we will be learning are:

**HTML**
HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another. 

**CSS**
By itself, HTML is quite plain. HTML does provide some basic style options, but to build a good frontend, developers must have experience with CSS. CSS provides the paint, templates, glitter, buttons, tassel, lights, and many other things that can be used to improve the presentation of a web page. CSS is so commonly used that languages have been built to make writing CSS easier. These languages – like Sass and LESS – are also known as CSS precompilers, but they are simply used to write more efficient and manageable CSS code. Scripting languages used for making Front-end of a web application.

**JAVASCRIPT**
Javascript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

**JQUERY**
jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library created by John Resig in 2006 with a nice motto − Write less, do more. jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
